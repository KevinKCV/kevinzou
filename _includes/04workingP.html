                Researchers suggested and introduced various voting rules and criteria to evaluate them. Evaluating each voting system’s strengths and weaknesses have been done in many studies. However, it is based on firm theoretical ground, not in practice. To check some criteria empirically, only knowing voters’ the first preferred candidate is not enough. Actual election data that have ranking or scoring is rarely available. We use two particular data-set, actual elections (FairVote) and surveys (Politbarometer), that include ranking and scoring data, and check the frequency of Condorcet paradox and Condorcet inconsistency, or monotonicity failures. Moreover, we suggest probabilistic models estimate them.
