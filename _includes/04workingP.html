                Researchers suggested and introduced various voting rules and criteria to evaluate them. Evaluating each voting system’s strengths and weaknesses have been done in many studies. However, it is based on firm theoretical ground, not in practice. To check some criteria empirically, only knowing voters’ the first preferred candidate is not enough. Actual election data that have ranking or scoring is rarely available. We use two particular data-set, actual elections (FairVote) and surveys (Politbarometer), that include ranking and scoring data, and check the frequency of Condorcet paradox and Condorcet inconsistency, or monotonicity failures. Moreover, we suggest probabilistic models estimate them.

                When there are two alternatives, the best way to decide one for group decision-making is majority rule. However, when there are more than two available options, it is not straightforward. Most of the previous literature of relevant fields focused on the three-candidate election, and when researchers were adopting spatial model, it is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. This paper targets a normal spatial model (Good and Tideman, 1976) with four candidates in three-dimensional attribute space. Most of our research is about the modeling process and technical details, parameterization of the models that can best describe the actual rank data. Furthermore, we test whether bimodal multivariate normal distribution assumption is more likely than unimodal multivariate normal distribution by AIC and BIC criteria.
