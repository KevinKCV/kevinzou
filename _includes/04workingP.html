                Besides the plurality rule, the most common and long history, researchers introduced and suggested various voting rules. It is still controversial which voting rule is the best, but researchers found that plurality is not the one. Instant Runoff Voting is not also, but it might be the next standard rule as its’ nickname, “the alternative vote.” Some countries and large cities in the US are officially using IRV already. Many studies are concerned about the disadvantages of IRV with theoretical approaches, not much with data analysis. We identify those concerns with two particular data-set, actual elections (FairVote) and surveys (Politbarometer) that include ranking and scoring data. Specifically, in the present paper, we check the data and estimate the frequency of Condorcet paradox and Condorcet inconsistency, which is directly related to the monotonicity criterion. Our modeling technique is empirical oriented; we count the winning vote gap between the Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser, and Condorcet winner and the third-placed by plurality rule as an indicator of Condorcet paradox and Condorcet inconsistency, respectively. With about 1,000 synthetic elections, we found one Condorcet Paradox and twenty Condorcet inconsistencies (frequency of monotonicity failure is 2.15%). Our model provides a better approximation than theoretical approaches; 2.18~5.46% from actual election data and 2.35~2.71% from the survey data. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between the Condorcet inconsistency and compatibility of using the one-dimensional spatial model.

                When there are two alternatives, the best way to decide one for group decision-making is majority rule. However, when there are more than two available options, it is not straightforward. Most of the previous literature of relevant fields focused on the three-candidate election, and when researchers were adopting spatial model, it is one-dimensional or two-dimensional. This paper targets a normal spatial model (Good and Tideman, 1976) with four candidates in three-dimensional attribute space. Most of our research is about the modeling process and technical details, parameterization of the models that can best describe the actual rank data. Furthermore, we test whether bimodal multivariate normal distribution assumption is more likely than unimodal multivariate normal distribution by AIC and BIC criteria.
