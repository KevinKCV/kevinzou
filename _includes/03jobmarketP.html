                    Voting cycles do exists, but much less frequently in practice than is predicted. This paper develops an estimate of the probability of a cycle that closer to what the data reveal. In the absence of an abundance of actual voting data in which voters rank candidates, survey data is the best alternative. We use German Politbarometer data, which offers two benefits for empirical analysis of voting systems; the fact that participants score the candidates and the large number of observations. We develop hypotheses and models based on cardinality. Specifically, we consider a 'median' of collected evaluations as a significant factor in predicting the winner of head-to-head comparisons, estimating the probability of a cycle from the probability of two sets of three events occurring. The model predicts a significantly lower voting cycle frequency than models based on the IC and IAC assumptions. Our approach involves 1) assigning three candidates presumed positions of first, second and third 2) noting the gaps between pairs of candidates in apparent estimated merit, and then 3) computing the probability that the three pairwise comparisons will have a combination of outcomes that results in a cycle.
