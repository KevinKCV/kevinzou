                    Theoretically Condorcet paradox exists and occurs, but much less in practice than it predicted. This paper targets estimating the probability of the paradox, nearer to what the data tells. To do this I use scoring data from a huge survey, which could be the best alternative of actual election data under ranked voting system, and suggest a different statistics and model based on the cardinality. Specifically, considering a 'median' of collected evaluations as a significant factor to predict the win of one-to-one comparison, and then approximating the probability of a cycle from the probability of two sets of three events occur. The model predicts significantly lower frequency of the voting cycle than popular models, probabilistic model with IC and IAC assumptions. our approach involves 1) assigning three candidates presumed positions of first, second and third 2) noting the gaps between pairs of candidates in apparent estimated merit, and then 3) computing the probability that the three pairwise comparisons will have a combination of outcomes that results in a cycle.
