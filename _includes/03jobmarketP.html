                    Theoretically, Condorcet paradox exists and occurs, but much less in practice than it predicted. This paper targets estimating the probability of the paradox, being closer to what the data tells. Survey data is the best alternative to actual election data under the ranked voting system. We use German Politbarometer, which offers two benefits for empirical analysis of voting systems; containing scoring data and the enormous observation size. We suggest different statistics and models based on cardinality. Specifically, considering a 'median' of collected evaluations as a significant factor in predicting the winner of one-to-one comparison, approximating the probability of a cycle from the probability of two sets of three events occur. The model predicts a significantly lower (but positive) voting cycle frequency than popular models, a probabilistic model with IC and IAC assumptions. Our approach involves 1) assigning three candidates presumed positions of first, second and third 2) noting the gaps between pairs of candidates in apparent estimated merit, and then 3) computing the probability that the three pairwise comparisons will have a combination of outcomes that results in a cycle.
