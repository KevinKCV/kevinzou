            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Virginia Tech and expect to graduate in May 2022. 
                Experimental Economics and Behavioral Economics are my main research interests. 
                My experimental work focuses on the sequential multi-battle contest that models the primary elections in the United States.
                On the other hand, my research on behavioral models covers various topics such as time preference and risk preference.

                I hold a master's degree in Economics from Virginia Tech, 
                a master's degree in Statistics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, 
                and a bachelor's degree in Economics from Kansas State University.

            I got a hint of Midwest, West, and South in me, but I'm "not in Kansas anymore." Ready for a journey in life!
