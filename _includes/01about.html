                I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Virginia Tech. My research field is public choice and voting. My work is mainly about evaluating voting rules and estimating voting paradoxes by empirical modeling. I hope to it could be a small contribution to finding the next "standard" of voting rules other than Plurality. I am also interested in persons' behavior and preferences.
