            <p class="paragraph-text justify-text">
                I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Virginia Tech. My research field is public choice and voting. My work is mainly about evaluating voting rules and estimating voting paradoxes by empirical modeling. I hope it could be a small contribution to finding the next "standard" of voting rules other than Plurality. I am also interested in techniques to capture the distribution of persons' preferences from the data and human behavior.

                I hold a master's degree and a bachelor's degree in Economics from Sungkyunkwan University. Back then, I was into studying applied microeconomics and communication games.
