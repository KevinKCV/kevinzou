                testsetshghgfhgetsetI am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Virginia Tech. My research field is public choice and voting. My work is mainly about evaluating voting rules and estimating voting paradoxes by empirical modeling. This can shed light on finding the next "standard" of voting rules other than Plurality. I am also interested in techniques to capture the distribution of persons' preferences from the data and human behavior.
